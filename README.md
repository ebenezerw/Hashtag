# Requirements

Instructions:

Use the Instagram and Flickr APIs to return all photos with a #dctech hashtag within the last month and rank them by the amount of comments each received.

With your solution please include:

1) Source code and instructions for building and running the solution.  Zip files or text files are fine - don't send executables.

2) The amount of time you spent solving the problem.

3) Any additional documentation or explanations of your work.  It's especially helpful if you explicitly call out any known deficiencies in the solution.  If you leverage third party work that's fine - just document this so we don't mistake that work for your own.
